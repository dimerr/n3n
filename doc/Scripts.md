# Scripts

There are a number of useful scripts included with the distribution.
Some of these scripts are only useful during build and development, but
other scripts are intended for end users to be able to use.  These scripts
may be installed with n3n as part of your operating system package.

All scripts can be found in the `scripts` directory.

Short descriptions of these scripts are below.

## End user scripts

### `n3nctl`

This python script provides an easy command line interface to the running
n3n processes.  It uses the management API and if there is only one daemon
running on the system, it will attempt to automatically locate it and talk
to its Unix domain socket.  it can talk to both the edge and the supernode
daemons.

Example:
- `scripts/n3nctl --help`
- `scripts/n3nctl help`

## Build and Development scripts

### `hack_fakeautoconf.sh`

This shell script is used during development to help build on Windows
systems.  An example of how to use it is shown in
the [Building document](Building.md)

### `indent.sh`

This shell script is a wrapper for the `uncrustify` C code style checker
which checks or applies a set of rules to the code.  It is used during
the automated lint checks.

### `n3n-gateway.sh`

A sample script to route all the host traffic towards a remote gateway,
which is reachable via the n3n virtual interface.

### `version.sh`

This script is used to determine the current version number during the
build process.

It looks at both the VERSION file and the GIT tags and outputs the
version number to use.

## Monitoring and statistics

### `munin/n3n_`

This is a simple monitoring script that can be used with the munin-node
system to monitor the n3n daemons.

This is a fully autoconfigurable wildcard munin plugin, but to get a quick
sample:

get a list of suggested plugin names:
```
munin/n3n_ suggest
```

Enable some of those names:

```
ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/n3n_ /etc/munin/plugins/n3n_supernode_pkts
ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/n3n_ /etc/munin/plugins/n3n_supernode_counts
```

Manually test fetching and config:

```
/etc/munin/plugins/n3n_supernode_pkts
/etc/munin/plugins/n3n_supernode_pkts config
```

## Testing scripts

### `test_harness.sh`

This shell script is used to run automated tests during development.  It is
run with a testlist filename - pointing at a file containing the list of
tests to run.

Each test needs a file containing the expected output `${TESTNAME}.expected`
which is expected to exist in the same directory as the testlist (this dir is
referred to as `${listdir}` below).

Each test is a program, searched for in several locations, including the
`${listdir}/../scripts` dir.

Each test is run with its output being sent to `*.out` files in the `listdir`
and compared with the expected output.

### `scripts/test_integration_supernode.sh`

This starts a supernode and runs an integration test on the Json API using
the `n3nctl` command.
